"For now, we are mostly interested in the detection step and how it "

"electron may be released at one of the physical pixels. During the "

"actually present in the sample -- but there are *a lot* of things that "

"The basic idea is simple: the software displaying the image uses a "

"One way we *could* make an image brighter is to change the pixel values "

"The danger is that **not all software cares so much about preserving "

"For this reason, a lot of software designed for working with images "
