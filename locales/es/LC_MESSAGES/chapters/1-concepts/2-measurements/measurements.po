"This is really important because there are lots of ways to accidentally "

"With the additional information at our disposal, we can immediately see "

"If two images have identical histograms and summary statistics (mean, "
"min, max, standard deviation), does this **prove** that the images are "
"identical?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/2-measurements/measurements.md
msgid "Answer"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/2-measurements/measurements.md:216
msgid ""
"No! For example, we might have the same pixel values in a different "
"arrangement. If I randomly shuffle the pixels in the image then the basic"
" statistics and histogram remain unchanged -- but the image itself is "
"very different."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/2-measurements/measurements.md:223
msgid ""
"This means that, technically, we can only really use histograms and "
"summary measurements to prove that images are definitely *not* the same."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/2-measurements/measurements.md:225
msgid ""
"However, in practice this is usually enough. If two images have identical"
" histograms and summary statistics *and* look similar, it is *very "
"likely* that they are the same."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/2-measurements/measurements.md:228
msgid ""
"Conceivably, someone might try to deceive us by making some very subtle "
"change to an image that preserves the statistics, such as as swapping two"
" pixels amongst millions so that we don't notice the difference. Later, "
"we'll see how to overcome even that by checking every single pixel -- but"
" such elaborate trickery probably isn't a very real risk for most of us."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/2-measurements/measurements.md:231
msgid ""
"Most of the time, when things go wrong with scientific images the "
"histogram and statistics will be compromised in an obvious way -- we just"
" need to remember to check for these changes."
