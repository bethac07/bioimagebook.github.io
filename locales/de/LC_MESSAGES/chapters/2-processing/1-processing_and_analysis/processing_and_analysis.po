"The first is to overcome limitations in image quality and make the really"
" interesting image content more clearly visible. This involves **image "
"processing**, the output of which is another image. The second is to "
"compute meaningful measurements, which could be presented in tables and "
"summary plots. This is **image analysis**."

"I tend to view the challenge of constructing any scientific image "

"extract some kind of quantitative measurements that are justified by the "
"nature of the experiment and the facts of image formation. One of the "

"Although this might initially seem inconvenient, it can be liberating: it"

"workflow, we usually have two main stages:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/1-processing_and_analysis/processing_and_analysis.md:81
msgid ""
"**Preprocessing**: the stuff you do to clean up the image, e.g. subtract "

msgid ""
"Having successfully navigated these stages, there are usually some "
"additional tasks remaining (e.g. making measurements of shape, intensity "
"or dynamics). However, these depend upon the specifics of the application"
" and are *usually* not the hard part. If you can identify what you want "
"to quantify, you're a long way towards solving the puzzle."
