"It's one thing to figure out steps that enable you to analyze an image, "
"it's quite another to implement these steps for several -- and perhaps "
"many -- different images. Without automation, the analysis might never "
"happen; all the mouse-moving and clicking would just be too time-"
"consuming, error-prone or boring, and momentarily lapses in concentration"
" could require starting over again."

"Even a brief effort to understand how to automate analysis can produce "
"vast, long-lasting improvements in personal productivity and sanity by "
"reducing the time spent on mind-numbingly repetitive tasks. In some "
"straightforward cases (e.g. converting file formats, applying projections"
" or filters, or making measurements across entire images), this can "
"already be done in ImageJ using the commands in the "
"{menuselection}`Process --> Batch -->` submenu and no programming "
"whatsoever. But it's also very worthwhile to get some experience in "
"producing macros, scripts or plugins, after which you can add your own "
"new commands to the menus and carry out customized algorithms with a "
"single click of a button or press of a key."

"The following sections are far from an extensive introduction to macro-"

"worked examples. Should you wish to delve deeper into the subject, "
"there's an [introduction to the language on the ImageJ "
"website](https://imagej.net/developer/macro/macros.html) [^fn_1], and a "
"[very helpful tutorial on the ImageJ "
"wiki](https://imagej.net/Introduction_into_Macro_Programming) [^fn_2], "
