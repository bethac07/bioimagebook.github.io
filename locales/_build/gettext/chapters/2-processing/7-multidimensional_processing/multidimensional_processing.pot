msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/7-multidimensional_processing/multidimensional_processing.md:91
msgid "The main consideration for thresholding in 3D is whether the other *z*-slices could introduce any kind of sneaky bias. One occasion when that could happen is if the images are acquired with different numbers of slices, e.g. some containing more out-of-focus planes than others ({numref}`fig-multi_thresholds`). These extra planes *could* impact the histogram and image statistics, and therefore any automated thresholds. An image with many out-of-focus slices might be thresholded differently from an image with few slices."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/7-multidimensional_processing/multidimensional_processing.md:96
msgid "A solution for that may be to extract a fixed number of slices from each image, for example 10 slices centered upon the volume of interest within the image. This should generally make the images more comparable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/7-multidimensional_processing/multidimensional_processing.md:228
msgid "Thresholding a z-stack can be influenced by the number of out-of-focus slices. Here, an automated threshold determined using [Otsu's method](sec_thresholds_otsu) is applied to two z-stacks showing the same object. The top stack contains few out-of-focus slices, while the bottom stack contains the exact same data plus additional slices that contain only noise. Otsu's method is well-suited to the top stack and performs well, however it fails badly on the bottom stack, where there is a much higher proportion of background pixels -- and so the background peak is more dominant."

msgid "**Linear filters** can be easily extended to *nD* by defining a filter kernel with the desired number of dimensions. However, this can dramatically increase the computational requirements and so we need to begin considering performance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/7-multidimensional_processing/multidimensional_processing.md:259
msgid "For example, suppose we have a 3×3 filter. Following the algorithm for linear filtering [described previously](sec_filters_linear), we would have to perform 9 multiplications and additions to determine the value for *every* pixel in the output image. If our image is 1000×1000 pixels in size, that suggests 9,000,000 multiplications and additions. This seems quite a lot, but modern computers are fast so we're unlikely to notice it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/7-multidimensional_processing/multidimensional_processing.md:264
msgid "However, if we have a 3×3×3 filter then each output pixel depends upon 27 input pixels. And the additional slices mean our image is likely to be bigger; say, 1000×1000×10 pixels. Now we have to perform calculations involving 270,000,000 pixels, i.e. a lot more. Still, even that is probably fast nowadays."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/7-multidimensional_processing/multidimensional_processing.md:269
msgid "But how big can we go? An 11×11 filter involves 121 pixels. But an 11×11×11 filter involves 1331. For larger filters and images, we can rapidly increase the computations involved until processing *is* very slow."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/7-multidimensional_processing/multidimensional_processing.md:276
msgid "The situation improves *dramatically* if a filter is **separable**. This means that instead of applying, for example, a single 11×11×11 filter (1331 coefficients) we can instead apply three separate 11×1 filters oriented along each dimension (33 coefficients)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/7-multidimensional_processing/multidimensional_processing.md:279
msgid "Not all linear filters are separable, but many common ones are. This includes mean filters (depending upon neigborhood shape) and Gaussian filters. The result of applying the filter separably should be the same as the result of applying one dense multidimensional filter ({numref}`fig-gauss_separable`). Some small differences may arise through the handling of [rounding and bit-depths](chap_bit_depths), but the improvement in performance is almost certainly worth any tiny error introduced by applying a filter separably."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/7-multidimensional_processing/multidimensional_processing.md:332
msgid "2D Gaussian smoothing can be applied using a single 2D filter, or by sequentially filtering either rows or columns of the image: the end result is the same (up to rounding error). The order of the separable filtering doesn't matter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/7-multidimensional_processing/multidimensional_processing.md:337
msgid "Considerations are similar for **nonlinear filters**: when we add more dimensions, the neighborhood size can increase quickly and make the calculations slow. Separability can help with some nonlinear filters (e.g. minimum and maximum, depending on window shape), but not all. Median filters in particular are difficult to optimize, and can be *extremely* slow when the neighborhood is large and/or more than 2D."

msgstr ""

msgid "As discussed {ref}`chap_pixel_size`, the pixel width and height are usually the same. For a *z*-stack, the *z*-spacing *might* be the same as the width and height, in which case the pixels are called **isotropic**. But very often the *z*-spacing is different, meaning that the pixels are **anisotropic**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/7-multidimensional_processing/multidimensional_processing.md:348
msgid "It helps to keep this in mind when choosing filter sizes. For example, I would usually set the $\\sigma$ value for a 3D Gaussian filter based upon the pixel size."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/7-multidimensional_processing/multidimensional_processing.md:351
msgid "Suppose that the pixel width and height are both 0.5 µm, and the *z*-spacing is 1 µm. I might then choose $\\sigma_x$ = 2 px, $\\sigma_y$ = 2 px and $\\sigma_z$ = 1 px to compensate for the difference."

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/7-multidimensional_processing/multidimensional_processing.md:425
msgid "A cumbersome workaround may be to resize the image so that the pixels *are* isotropic, but that may make every other analysis step more complicated and/or require a huge amount more memory to store the image.

As someone who writes software, I can attest that I don't tend to support more dimensions than I have to because extra dimensions make the task of coding, debugging and optimizing much, much harder."

If a separable filter can be used instead, you can shrink that figure to 147 (~0.12%). Perhaps the calculation can also be performed on a lower resolution image, saving even more effort."

msgid "Most modern computers capable of image analysis contain multiple processors, which can do multiple things at the same time. Image analysis software that supports **multiprocessing** is able to use these processors to operate on different parts of the data simultaneously. It's more work for the programmer, but better for the user."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/7-multidimensional_processing/multidimensional_processing.md:461
msgid "The benefits of multiprocessing can be important, but still tend to be fairly modest. A typical desktop computer today could have between 2 and 8 processors (although particularly powerful machines can have more). However, doubling the numbers of processors doesn't mean that the computation time is likely to be halved, because it's hard for software to keep all the processors occupied. Tasks tend to depend upon one another, and so it's common for one processor to have to lounge around while another processor is completing its part of the job. Our performance aspirations can also be thwarted by other bottlenecks, such as reading or writing images."
