"These are relevant here, but my advice is to avoid them. By default they "
"work with fixed 3Ã—3 pixel neighborhoods, but they *could* do something "
"different if someone has been messing about with the "

"unpredictability could well cause trouble."

"To perform erosion, dilation, opening and closing with more control and "
