"Initially, everything seems incomprehensible. If you can immerse yourself"
" in the language sufficiently, patterns start to emerge and parts begin "
"to make sense. But even so, speaking it fluently can still feel a long "

"This book tries to accelerate the process by systematically teaching the "
"basic grammar and core vocabulary of image analysis: the rules, concepts,"
" and tools that (bio)image analysts use every day. It aims to go beyond a"
" superficial overview by describing many of the exceptions, pitfalls and "
"messy realities encountered when working with images: the things I wish I"
" had learned sooner when I started out myself. The things I didn't know "
"that I needed to know, or didn't know even existed."

"If you've worked through the chapters, I hope that they could help you "
"develop a solid basis to understand the language of image analysis. If "
"you want to go further, my advice would be to start using it to "

"The **Scientific Community Image Forum** at **https://forum.image.sc** is"

"lists that predated it."
